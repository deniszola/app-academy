/**
 * In-place recursive sort (Mutates the original array)
 *
 * Time and space complexity analysis
 *
 * - Time complexity: O(nÂ²)
 * Let's start with the time complexity of recursiveSort.
 * Each recursive call sorts one value,
 * so there will be n total recursive calls to sort an array of length n.
 * Each call iterates through the entire array to find the max value which is O(n),
 * then splices out the max value which is also O(n).
 * These are not nested, so the overall time complexity of each call is O(2n),
 * or just O(n) since coefficients are ignored.
 * Since this is called n times through recursion, the overall time complexity is O(n2).
 *
 * - Space complexity: O(n)
 * Since arr.splice and arr.push both mutate the original array and no new arrays are created,
 * this algorithm works in-place with each call using O(1) extra space.
 * However, you may recall that each function is stored in memory on the call stack_
 * while it waits for later recursive functions to resolve. Since there are n recursive steps,
 * this function will occupy O(n) space on the call stack.
